      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Tosin Abasi was born in Washington D.C. to Nigerian immigrants to the United States. Abasi is a mainly self-taught guitarist. He first picked up a guitar at his friend's house, simply strumming it and making up basic licks on the spot. At this time he was being exposed to some music through learning the clarinet in elementary school. He later began to rent hair metal guitarists' instructional video tapes from his local music store. Abasi said that when he decided to learn the guitar, his father was <em>"totally liberal about the whole thing and encouraging and proud"</em> and in fact, bought him his first guitar. However his mother initially held a more conservative outlook. Tosin said in an interview, <em>â€œMy mom definitely represents more of the traditional immigrant mentality of education and conventional channels being way more important than a creative endeavor".</em></p>

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>He was the guitarist for the Silver Spring, Maryland-based metal band PSI before moving onto join the technical metalcore band Reflux in the early to mid-2000s.

Javier Reyes and Navene Koperweis were enlisted on rhythm guitar and drums, respectively, after the completion of the album, turning the project into a full touring band.</p>
